This code reads data from 3 IMUs and send them using Bluetooth Low Energy.
It was designed on an Adafruit Feather nRF52 to work with BNO055 addressed using IÂ²C through a multiplexer.
The bluetooth part of the code is mostly inspired from https://lean.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/custom-hrm
